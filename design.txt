The break down
The first step was creating the constants that would be used in all the functions to reduce the amount of typing to be done while
coding the functions. This is done in the code shown below.

This constant stores the skill name to be used by the function to be able to locate what it is looking for.
const SKILL_NAME = 'World Facts';

This constant is just a string that is included in the begining of every function.
const GET_FACT_MESSAGE = "Your fun fact about ";

This was built in to the blueprint however I modified it to compliment my program so when the user says help this string with display.
const HELP_MESSAGE = 'You can say tell me a world fact, or, you can say exit... What can I help you with?';

This was also built in and plays if the user does not reposnd to the first help message prompt.
const HELP_REPROMPT = 'What can I help you with?';

This is a string that plays when the user stops the program.
const STOP_MESSAGE = 'Hope you had fun learning! bye!';


The next constants were 7 arrays all assigned to one continent that stored multiple facts about each continent.

This bit of code starts the program when the intro intent is said then prompts the user to pick a continent and listens to what the user says.
'introintent': function () {
        //Asks what continents array to call the fact from
        this.response.speak("what continent do you want to learn about?").listen("what continent do you want to learn about?");
        this.emit(':responseReady');
       
This was a built in function that emits the constant HELP_MESSAGE and will display HELP_REPROMPT if the user doesnt answer in a certain amount of time.
 'AMAZON.HelpIntent': function () {
        const speechOutput = HELP_MESSAGE;
        const reprompt = HELP_REPROMPT;

        this.response.speak(speechOutput).listen(reprompt);
        this.emit(':responseReady');
    },
    
    This function is used to exit the code.
    'AMAZON.StopIntent': function () {
        this.response.speak(STOP_MESSAGE);
        this.emit(':responseReady');
    },
    
    There are 7 functions like this for each continent. This function is called when the user says North America. The function will the cotant GET_FACT_MESSAGE which is "Your fun fact about " then display N
     'northAmericaFacts': function () {
        const factArr = NORTHAMERICA;
        const factIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * factArr.length);
        const randomFact = factArr[factIndex];
        const speechOutput = GET_FACT_MESSAGE + 'North America is ' + randomFact;
        
         this.response.cardRenderer(SKILL_NAME, randomFact);
        //Outputs speech and listens for another continent to be said.
        this.response.speak(speechOutput + ' If you want to hear another fact say another or the same continent').listen("what continent do you want to learn about?");
        this.emit(':responseReady');

    },
